A program that generates its own source code and Makefile

Uses ld to generate obj files from the source code and makefile files, and
embeds the objects in the built executable. Embedded data sections are
demarcated with symbols.
Runing the program creates a new directory and writes the embedded data back to
new corresponding files.

dev note:
objdumb -t main_c.o     #Inspect symbols in object file
